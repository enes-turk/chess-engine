# Chess Engine and AI

This personal project combines my passion for chess with my desire to learn object-oriented programming.

# Tools Utilized

Python was the sole language used in this project, with Pygame serving as the primary library for creating game states to physically interact with the game board.

# The Engine

### Board

This chess engine allows players to engage in player versus player (PvP) matches or challenge an AI bot. Additionally, it offers the option to spectate matches between AI opponents. As you can see on the side of the board, we have a game log screen using professional chess notations to follow what has been done in the match.

### **Functionalities**

Every functionality required by the centuries-old game of chess can be found within this engine.

#### Undo Moves

Mistakes happen, but fear not! You can undo moves to rectify any rookie errors. The log also gets updated to the current state.

Seize the opportunity to fortify your king's position through castling maneuvers, available on both flanks of the board.

#### En Passant

Embracing the complexity of chess, the en passant rule has been seamlessly integrated into the game mechanics.

#### Checkmate, Stalemate

And in the finale, you can be the one to deliver the final blow with a checkmate.
