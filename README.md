# Chess Engine and AI

This personal project merges my passion for chess with my eagerness to delve into object-oriented programming.

# Tools Utilized

Python was the sole language utilized in this project, with Pygame serving as the primary library for constructing game states to interact with the game board.

# The Engine

### Board

- This chess engine facilitates player versus player (PvP) matches or challenges against an AI opponent. Additionally, it provides the option to spectate matches between AI opponents.
- Smooth animations have been implemented to enhance immersion.
- Illuminated squares have been introduced to offer visual cues regarding valid piece movements.
- On the side of the board, a game log screen using professional chess notations allows players to track the progression of the match.

### **Functionalities**

Every essential functionality of the centuries-old game of chess is embedded within this engine.

#### Undo Moves

Mistakes happen, but fear not! You can undo moves to rectify any rookie errors. The log also updates to reflect the current state.
